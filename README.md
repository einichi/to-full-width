# to-full-width

Convert characters to full-width equivalents where they exist.

Currently focuses on use-cases in Japan only, specifically for web forms that require names and addresses, but requires the entire string to have full-width characters only for processing on the back-end.

Possibly not accurate at this time. Check the tests and run your own tests to make sure it meets your requirements.
